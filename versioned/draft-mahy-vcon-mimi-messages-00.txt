1.  Introduction

   VCON [I-D.ietf-vcon-vcon-container] is a format for recording and
   transmitting conversations.  MIMI content [I-D.ietf-mimi-content] is
   a format for conveying Instant Messages in an interoperable way when
   end-to-end encrypted.  This document describes a way to translate a
   set of MIMI messages in a conversation or part of a conversation into
   a VCON.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Syntax

   A MIMI conversation (or portion thereof) is represented in VCON with
   a mandatory list of parties and dialogs, a new top-level room object.

3.1.  Room information

   This document adds a top-level room object.  It contains metadata
   known about the room at the start of the VCON period.

   *  id is the MIMI room ID URL.  It is mandatory.

   *  name is the textual name of the room.  It is optional.

3.2.  Parties

   The parties array MUST contain all the participants who were in the
   conversation at any point in time during the period represented by
   the VCON.

   This document adds a new party_object_type: imUri.  It is mandatory.
   The name field is optional.  The role indicates the MIMI role and is
   optional.

3.3.  Extensions to the dialog object

   The dialog object consists of an array of instant messages of type
   "text".  The start time is set to the hub received timestamp when
   available.  The duration is zero.  The parties array consist of the
   party indexes of those who were active participants when the message
   was sent.  The originator is set to the parties index of the sender
   of the message.

   *  messageId is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content messageId.
      It is mandatory.

   *  replaces is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content messageId
      of the message this message replaces.  It is optional if empty.

   *  expires is the expiration date/time of the message expressed as a
      VCON (text) date_type.  It is optional if empty.

   *  inReplyTo is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content messageId
      of the message to which this message is replying (or reacting).
      It is optional if empty.

   *  lastSeen is an array of base64url-encoded message ids.  It is
      mandatory.

   *  mimiExtensions is a object (map) containing MIMI extensions.  It
      is optional.

   VCON typically expresses content using the body, encoding, and
   mimetype fields.  In order to preserve this convention we use these
   fields directly for a MIMI SinglePart structure, but use new
   MultiPart and ExternalPart structure for those MIMI structures.

   ExternalPart has several fields for the decryption and integrity of
   the referenced content.  These can be omitted once the content has
   been downloaded, decrypted, verified, and included in the VCON
   attachments array.

   *  disposition - optional if set to the default value ("render")

   *  language - optional if absent

   *  partIndex is an integer.  It is mandatory

3.4.  MultiPart

   *  partSemantics is one of "chooseOne", "singleUnit", or
      "processAll".  It is mandatory.

   *  parts is an array of Parts.  It is mandatory.

3.5.  ExternalPart

   *  mimetype (contentType in MIMI). optional but recommended.

   *  url is the URL of the content as a text string. mandatory

   *  expires is a date_type (text) date. optional.

   *  size is an integer number of octets. optional.

   *  description is a text string. optional.

   *  filename is a text string. optional.

   These encryption/validation related fields can be omitted once the
   content is available locally as an attachment.  All of them are
   base64url encoded strings.  Otherwise they are mandatory if present
   in the MIMI content.

   *  encAlg

   *  key

   *  nonce

   *  aad

   *  hashAlg

   *  contentHash

   *TODO*: how to represent a downloaded and decrypted object in
   attachments?

3.6.  Part

   *  disposition - optional if set to the default value ("render")

   *  language - optional if absent

   *  partIndex is an integer.  It is mandatory

   *  cardinality is one of "nullpart", "single", "external", or
      "multi". mandatory.

   if cardinality is "single", then body, encoding, and mimetype fields
   are included directly in the Part object.

3.7.  Changes to the room

   Changes to the room metadata or participation should be accompanied
   by a new dialog type:

   *  room metadata changes

   *  participants joining and leaving

   *  participants adding new clients

   *  moderation events?

   *TODO*

3.8.  party_event_type events

party_event_type.event /= "add" / "welcome" / "leave" / "remove" / "ban"

   *  add: user added herself directly

   *  welcome: user added by someone else

   *  leave: user leaves of their own accord

   *  remove: user is removed by another user

   *  ban: user is banned from the group

4.  Examples

   Will fill in after the draft deadline.
