1.  Introduction

   VCON [I-D.ietf-vcon-vcon-container] is a format for recording and
   transmitting conversations.  MIMI content [I-D.ietf-mimi-content] is
   a format for conveying Instant Messages in an interoperable way when
   end-to-end encrypted.  This document describes a way to translate a
   set of MIMI messages in a conversation or part of a conversation into
   a VCON.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Syntax

   A MIMI conversation (or portion thereof) is represented in VCON with
   a mandatory list of parties and dialogs, a new top-level room object,
   and optionally attachment objects.

3.1.  Room information

   This document adds a top-level room object.  It contains metadata
   known about the room at the start of the VCON period.

   *  id is the MIMI room ID URL.  It is mandatory.

   *  name is the textual name of the room.  It is optional.

3.2.  Parties

   The parties array MUST contain all the participants who were in the
   conversation at any point in time during the period represented by
   the VCON.

   This document adds a new party_object_type: imUri.  It is mandatory.
   The name field is optional.  The role indicates the MIMI role and is
   optional.  The document also adds a thumbprint party_object_type,
   which is the JWK thumbprint of the public key of the party.  If there
   are multiple parties (clients) with the same imUri then the
   thumbprint is required, otherwise it is optional.

3.3.  Extensions to the dialog object

   The dialog object consists of an array of instant messages of type
   "text".  The start time is set to the hub received timestamp when
   available.  The duration is zero.  The parties array consist of the
   party indexes of those who were active participants when the message
   was sent.  The originator is set to the parties index of the sender
   of the message.

   *  messageId is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content messageId.
      It is mandatory.

   *  replaces is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content messageId
      of the message this message replaces.  It is optional if empty.

   *  topicId is the base64url encoding of the MIMI topicId.  It is
      optional if empty.

   *  expires is the expiration date/time of the message expressed as a
      VCON (text) date_type.  It is optional if empty.

   *  inReplyTo is an array of three values: the base64url encoding of
      the MIMI content messageId of the message to which this message is
      replying (or reacting), the hash algorithm expressed as an integer
      (SHA-256 is 1), and the base64url hash of the decrypted mimi-
      content.  It is optional if empty.

   *  lastSeen is an array of base64url-encoded message ids.  It is
      mandatory.

   *  mimiExtensions is a object (map) containing MIMI extensions.  It
      is optional.

   VCON typically expresses content using the body, encoding, and
   mimetype fields.  In order to preserve this convention we use these
   fields directly for a MIMI SinglePart structure, but use new
   MultiPart and ExternalPart structure for those MIMI structures.  For
   a SinglePart these two fields could be present.

   *  disposition - optional if set to the default value ("render")

   *  language - optional if absent

   If there is only a single part its "partIndex" is 0.

3.4.  MultiPart

   *  partSemantics is one of "chooseOne", "singleUnit", or
      "processAll".  It is mandatory.

   *  parts is an array of Parts.  It is mandatory.

3.5.  Part

   *  disposition - optional if set to the default value ("render")

   *  language - optional if absent

   *  partIndex is an unsigned integer.  It is mandatory in a Part
      object.

   *  cardinality is one of "nullpart", "single", "external", or
      "multi". mandatory.

   if cardinality is "single" or "external", then body, encoding, and
   mimetype fields are included directly in the Part object.

3.6.  ExternalPart

   *  mimetype (contentType in MIMI). optional but recommended.

   *  url is the URL of the content as a text string. mandatory

   *  expires is a date_type (text) date. optional.

   *  size is an integer number of octets. optional.

   *  description is a text string. optional.

   *  filename is a text string. optional.

   *  cached is a boolean.  It is mandatory if it is true, which means
      that a copy of the external content is available in a vcon
      attachment object (see {#attachments}).

   *  contentHash is the base64url encoded string of the hash of the
      external content, prefixed with the name of the hash algorithm and
      a colon (for example "sha256:"). contentHash is optional unless
      the external content has been included in a vcon attachment
      object.

   ExternalPart has several fields for the decryption of the referenced
   content.  These can be omitted once the content has been downloaded,
   decrypted, verified, and included in the VCON attachments array.  All
   of them are base64url encoded strings.  Otherwise they are mandatory
   if present in the MIMI content.

   *  encAlg

   *  key

   *  nonce

   *  aad

3.7.  Changes to the room

   Changes to the room metadata or participation should be accompanied
   by a new dialog type:

   *  room metadata changes

   *  participant identity change

   *  participants joining and leaving

   *  participants adding new clients

   *  moderation events?

   *TODO* add additional fields

3.8.  party_event_type events

   When there is a change to the parties represented in a room, the
   party_event_type.event is added.

party_event_type.event /= "add" / "welcome" / "leave" / "remove" / "ban"

   *  add: user added herself directly

   *  welcome: user added by someone else

   *  leave: user leaves of their own accord

   *  remove: user is removed by another user

   *  ban: user is banned from the group

4.  Attachments

   An attachment consists of the following fields:

   *  start: is the time when the attachment was downloaded. it is
      mandatory.

   *  party: is the party that downloaded the attachment. it is
      mandatory.

   *  contentHash: is the base64url encoded hash using the hash name
      prefixed with a colon before the hash (ex: "sha256:").  It is
      mandatory.

   *  dialogObjectRed is a string consisting of: "mid:" (representing
      the message ID URI), the messageId of the message in the dialog
      object, a colon, the partIndex of the Part (or "0" if the
      ExternalPart is at the top level), and the string
      "@anonymous.invalid"

   mimetype, filename, encoding, and body are as defined in vcon and are
   all mandatory.

5.  Examples

5.1.  MIMI examples as a VCON

   The example vcon consists of the example messages from Section 5 of
   the MIMI content specification plus a single multipart message.
