1.  Introduction

   VCON [I-D.ietf-vcon-vcon-container] is a format for recording and
   transmitting conversations.  MIMI content [I-D.ietf-mimi-content] is
   a format for conveying Instant Messages in an interoperable way when
   end-to-end encrypted.  This document describes a way to translate a
   set of MIMI messages in a conversation or part of a conversation into
   a VCON.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The examples in this document may contain base64url encoded values
   that have extra whitespace added for readability, and to conform with
   Internet-Draft formatting conventions.  That whitespace should be
   ignored.

   Some metadata about a MIMI content message is conveyed in the
   encryption protocol Messaging Layer Security (MLS) [RFC9420] or in
   the MIMI protocol [I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol].

   For example, the sender, recipient, date, and message ID are not
   mandatory fields in a MIMI content message.  The recipient is the
   MIMI room ID associated with the corresponding MLS group.  The
   participants in the group are calculated from the MLS group state and
   MIMI participant list during the MLS "epoch" in which the message was
   sent.  The sender is conveyed in MLS.  The MIMI "Hub" received
   timestamp is conveyed in the MIMI protocol.  The MIMI content message
   ID is constructed by hashing fields from the MIMI content, and the
   sender and room URIs (see Section 3.3 of [I-D.ietf-mimi-content]).

   When message franking is enabled, as defined in Section 5.4.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol], the franking_tag is conveyed in the MLS
   message's Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) field, while the MIMI
   protocol conveys the Frank structure generated by the MIMI Hub.

   The room metadata described in this document comes from Section 3 of
   [I-D.mahy-mimi-app-components], while the names of the parties comes
   from the participant list defined in Section 4 of the same document.

3.  Syntax

   A MIMI conversation (or portion thereof) is represented in VCON with
   a mandatory list of parties and dialogs, a new top-level room object,
   and optionally attachment objects.

3.1.  Room information

   This document adds a mandatory, top-level room object.  It contains
   metadata known about the room at the start of the VCON period.

   *  id is the MIMI room ID URL.  It is mandatory.

   *  name is the textual name of the room.  It is optional.

   *  avatar is a URL referencing the room image.  It is optional.

   *  subject is the room subject.  It is optional.

   *  mood is the room mood.  It is optional

   *  description is an array of room_description objects.  It is
      optional.  Each object can contain:

      -  a type- a media type or an empty string.  It is optional.  It's
         default value is text/plain;charset=UTF-8.

      -  a lang - a Language-tag as defined by [RFC5646].  It is
         optional.

      -  a content - if the type begins with "text" or is empty, the
         content the is UTF-8 text description of the room.  Otherwise
         it is the base64url encoding of whatever type is described.
         The content field is mandatory in a room_description object.

3.2.  Parties

   The parties array MUST contain all the participants who were in the
   conversation at any point in time during the period represented by
   the VCON.  The first party in the array is the MIMI room URI.

   This document adds a new party_object_type: im_uri.  It is mandatory.
   The name field is optional.  The role indicates the MIMI role and is
   optional.  The document also adds a thumbprint party_object_type,
   which is the JWK thumbprint of the public key of the party.  If there
   are multiple parties (clients) with the same im_uri then the
   thumbprint is required, otherwise it is optional.

3.3.  The dialog object (text type)

   The following section refers to changes and additions to the dialog
   object when the type field is "text".

3.3.1.  Semantics of the existing fields for text

   The dialog object consists of an array of instant messages of type
   "text".  The start time is set to the hub received timestamp when
   available.  The duration is zero.  The originator is set to the
   parties index of the sender of the message.

   The first MIMI message represented in a MIMI VCON should contain the
   complete list of parties who were participants in the room at that
   time.  For subsequent messages, a parties array consisting of index
   zero, indicates the recipients of the message are the active
   participants of the room.  Changes to the roster can be tracked if
   party_history is present for those changes (see Section 3.4).

3.3.2.  Extensions to the dialog object for text

   The parties array consist of the party indexes of those who were
   active participants when the message was sent.

   *  message_id is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content message
      ID.  It is mandatory.

   *  salt is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content salt.  It is
      mandatory.

   *  replaces is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content message_id
      of the message this message replaces.  It is optional if empty.

   *  topic_id is the base64url encoding of the MIMI topic_id.  It is
      optional if empty.

   *  expires is optional if empty in MIMI.  It contains null or a map
      with the following items:

      -  relative is a boolean that is true if the time is expressed
         relative to the recipient read time, and false if it is
         expressed as an absolute date/time.  It is mandatory when
         expires is present.

      -  relative_time is an integer number of seconds.  If relative is
         true, once the message has been read, the client is expected to
         delete the message after relative_time seconds.  It is
         mandatory if relative is true.

      -  absolute_time is the expiration date/time of the message
         expressed as a VCON (text) date_type.  It is mandatory if
         relative is false and optional otherwise.

   *  in_reply_to is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content
      message_id of the message to which this message is replying (or
      reacting).  It is optional if empty.

   *  mimi_extensions is a base64 encoding of the CBOR MIMI content
      extensions map or null.  It is optional if not present in the MIMI
      content.

   *  franking_tag is a base64url encoding of the MIMI franking_tag, or
      null.  It is optional if not present.

   *  frank is a base64url encoding of the MIMI protocol Frank TLS
      struct, or null.  It is optional if not present.

   VCON typically expresses message content using the body, encoding,
   and mediatype fields.  In order to preserve this convention we use
   these fields directly for a MIMI SinglePart structure, but use new
   MultiPart and ExternalPart objects for those corresponding MIMI
   structures.  For a SinglePart these two fields with the same
   semantics as their MIMI content counterparts could be present.

   *  disposition - optional if set to the default value ("render")

   *  language - optional if absent

   If there is only a single part its part_index is 0, and in this case
   it is optional.

3.3.3.  MultiPart objects

   A MultiPart object is designed to carry multiple items, as with the
   MultiPart structure in MIMI content or the top level multipart media
   types.  It contains the following fields.

   *  part_semantics is one of "chooseOne", "singleUnit", or
      "processAll".  It is mandatory.

   *  parts is an array of Parts.  It is mandatory in a MultiPart
      object.

3.3.4.  Part objects

   The following fields can be in a Part object.  They have the same
   meaning as their MIMI content counterparts.

   *  disposition optional if set to the default value ("render")

   *  language - optional if absent

   *  part_index is an unsigned integer.  It is mandatory in a Part
      object.

   *  cardinality is one of "nullpart", "single", "external", or
      "multi". mandatory.

   If cardinality is "single" or "external", then body, encoding, and
   mediatype fields are included directly in the Part object.

3.3.5.  ExternalPart objects

   The ExternalPart object can contain the following fields with similar
   meanings to those in MIMI content, with exceptions noted below.

   *  mediatype is the value of the contentType in MIMI.  It is
      mandatory if present in the MIMI message and recommended
      otherwise.

   *  url is the URL of the content as a text string.  It is mandatory

   *  expires is a date_type (text) date.  It is optional if not
      present.

   *  size is an integer number of octets.  It is optional if not
      present.

   *  description is a text string.  It is optional if not present.

   *  filename is a text string.  It is optional if not present.

   *  content_hash is the base64url encoded string of the MIMI
      contentHash of the ExternalPart, prefixed with the name of the
      hash algorithm corresponding to hashAlg and a colon (for example
      "sha256:"). content_hash is mandatory if it was included in the
      MIMI content ExternalPart, and omitted otherwise.

   In addition, the following fields are unique to MIMI VCON.

   *  cached is a boolean.  It is mandatory if it is true, which means
      that a copy of the external content is available in a vcon
      attachment object (see {#attachments}).  If cache is true and no
      content_hash is present, a new content hash is calculated for the
      attachment and placed the cache_ref field (which can only be
      present in this case).

   ExternalPart has several fields for the decryption of the referenced
   content.  If it is not necessary to reconstruct the original MIMI
   content (for example to allow later verification of the message ID),
   these fields can be omitted once the content has been downloaded,
   decrypted, verified, and included in the VCON attachments array.
   Otherwise they are mandatory if present in the MIMI content.  All of
   these fields are base64url encoded strings.

   *  encAlg

   *  key

   *  nonce

   *  aad

3.4.  Changes to the parties

   The party_history object can be interleaved with text objects in the
   dialog objects array.  It indicates when changes have been made to
   the participants represented by party index zero, as well as
   properties of individual parties (such as their role or name).

   The party_history object contains the following fields. - party is
   the party index of the modified party.  It is mandatory. - originator
   is the party that originated the change.  It is optional. - time is
   the time that the change was effected - event is the type of change.
   It is mandatory and for MIMI VCONs can be one of the following new
   event types:

* `add`: user added by someone else
* `self_add`: user added herself directly
* `leave`: user leaves of their own accord
* `remove`: user is removed by another user
* `ban`: user is banned from the group
* `update`: - `name` is the new name of the user. It is only permitted for an update event. - `role` is the new role assigned to the user. It is only permitted for an update event.

3.5.  Changes to the room

   Changes to the room metadata should be accompanied by a new room
   dialog type.  The room dialog type can contain anything in the top-
   level room object except for the id (which cannot change).  It must
   contain a time field to convey the time of the change, and may
   contain an originator field to convey who made that change.

3.6.  Attachments

   An attachment consists of the following fields:

   *  start: is the time when the attachment was downloaded.  It is
      mandatory.

   *  party: is the party that downloaded the attachment.  It is
      mandatory.

   *  content_hash: is the base64url encoded hash using the hash name
      prefixed with a colon before the hash (ex: "sha256:").  It is
      mandatory.

   *  dialog_object_ref is a string consisting of: "mid:" (representing
      the message ID URI), the message_id of the message in the dialog
      object, a colon, the part_index of the Part (or "0" if the
      ExternalPart is at the top level), and the string "@anon.invalid"

   The mediatype, filename, encoding, and body fields are as they are
   defined in VCON and are all mandatory.

3.7.  Message tombstones

   When a message has been deleted/retracted, or it expires, it can be
   valuable to present a record that such a message was previously
   present, by generating a dialog object with the following fields
   (which are all mandatory):

   *  type is "tombstone"

   *  start is the time the tombstone was generated

   *  message_id is the message ID of the message.

   *  status is the status of the former message, either "retracted" or
      "expired".

4.  Examples

4.1.  MIMI examples as a VCON

   The example vcon consists of the example messages from Section 5 of
   the MIMI content specification plus a party_history object adding tow
   new participants, and a single multipart message at the end.

Appendix A.  CDDL changes

   *TODO*

Appendix B.  Change list

B.1.  Changes in draft-mahy-vcon-mimi-messages-02

   *  adjust to make consisten with new syntax of MIMI content (add
      salt, removed lastSeen, in_reply_to is just a message id, expires
      is an object to handle relative expiration, added
      mimi_extensions).

   *  use a different field from content_hash when attaching an
      ExternalPart that did not have a hash in the MIMI message.

   *  allow the parties list of 0 to indicate sending to every active
      participant in the room.

   *  added a description of using party_history to track changes to the
      participant list.

   *  added room metadata, and a way to modify it

   *  added support for message "tombstones"

   *  use mediatype instead of mimetype throughout

   *  make the case of field names more consistent
