# Introduction

VCON {{!I-D.ietf-vcon-vcon-container}} is a format for recording and
transmitting conversations. MIMI content {{!I-D.ietf-mimi-content}}
is a format for conveying Instant Messages in an interoperable way
when end-to-end encrypted. This document describes a way to translate
a set of MIMI messages in a conversation or part of a conversation into
a VCON.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Some metadata about a MIMI content message is conveyed in the encryption protocol Messaging Layer Security (MLS) {{!RFC9420}} or in the MIMI protocol {{!I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol}}.

For example, the sender, recipient, date, and message ID are not mandatory fields in a MIMI content message.
The recipient is the MIMI room ID associated with the corresponding MLS group.
The participants in the group are calculated from the MLS group state and MIMI participant list during the MLS "epoch" in which the message was sent.
The sender is conveyed in MLS.
The MIMI "Hub" received timestamp is conveyed in the MIMI protocol.
The MIMI content message ID is constructed by hashing fields from the MIMI content, and the sender and room URIs (see {{Section 3.3 of !I-D.ietf-mimi-content}}).

When message franking is enabled as defined in {{Section 5.4.1 of !I-D.ietf-mimi-protocol}}, the `franking_tag` is conveyed in the MLS message's Additional Authenticated Data (AAD) field, while the MIMI protocol conveys the `Frank` structure generated by the MIMI Hub.

# Syntax

A MIMI conversation (or portion thereof) is represented in VCON with
a mandatory list of parties and dialogs, a new top-level room object,
and optionally attachment objects.

## Room information

This document adds a top-level `room` object. It contains metadata
known about the room at the start of the VCON period.

- `id` is the MIMI room ID URL. It is mandatory.
- `name` is the textual name of the room. It is optional.
- `avatar` is a URL referencing the room image. It is optional.
- `subject` is the room subject. It is optional.
- `mood` is the room mood. It is optional
- `description` is an array of room_description objects. It is optional. Each object can contain:
    * a `type`- a media type or an empty string. It is optional. It's default value is `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`.
    * a `language` - a language string. It is optional.
    * a `content` - if the `type` begins with "text" or is empty, the content the is UTF-8 text description of the room. Otherwise it is the base64url encoding of whatever type is described. The `content` field is mandatory in a room_description object.

## Parties

The `parties` array MUST contain all the
participants who were in the conversation at any point in time during the
period represented by the VCON. The first party in the array is the MIMI room URI.

This document adds a new party_object_type: `im_uri`. It is mandatory.
The `name` field is optional. The `role` indicates the MIMI role and is
optional. The document also adds a `thumbprint` party_object_type, which is
the JWK thumbprint of the public key of the party. If there are multiple
parties (clients) with the same `im_uri` then the thumbprint is required,
otherwise it is optional.

## Semantics of the dialog object's existing fields

The dialog object consists of an array of instant messages of type "text".
The start time is set to the hub received timestamp when available.
The duration is zero.
The originator is set to the parties index of the sender of the message.

The first MIMI message represented in a MIMI VCON should contain the complete list of parties who were participants in the room at that time.
For subsequent messages, a parties array consisting of index zero, indicates the recipients of the message are the active participants of the room.
Changes to the roster can be tracked if `party_history` is present for those changes (see {{party-history}}).

**TODO** remove or define:
mime_type
encoding
body


## Extensions to the dialog object

The parties array consist of the party indexes of those who were active participants when the message was sent.

- `message_id` is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content message ID. It is mandatory.
- `salt` is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content salt. It is mandatory.
- `replaces` is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content message_id of the message this message replaces. It is optional if empty.
- `topic_id` is the base64url encoding of the MIMI topic_id. It is optional if empty.
- `expires` is optional if empty in MIMI. It contains null or a map with the following items:
    * `relative` is a boolean that is true if the time is expressed relative to the recipient read time, and false if it is expressed as an absolute date/time. It is mandatory when `expires` is present.
    * `relative_time` is an integer number of seconds. If `relative` is true, once the message has been read, the client is expected to delete the message after `relative_time` seconds. It is mandatory if `relative` is true.
    * `absolute_time` is the expiration date/time of the message expressed as a VCON (text) date_type. It is mandatory if `relative` is false and optional otherwise.
- `in_reply_to` is the base64url encoding of the MIMI content message_id of the message to which this message is replying (or reacting). It is optional if empty.
- `mimi_extensions` is a base64 encoding of the CBOR MIMI content extensions map or null. It is optional if not present in the MIMI content.
- `franking_tag` is a base64url encoding of the MIMI `franking_tag`, or null.  It is optional if not present.
- `frank` is a base64url encoding of the MIMI protocol `Frank` TLS struct, or null. It is optional if not present.

VCON typically expresses message content using the body, encoding, and mimetype
fields. In order to preserve this convention we use these fields directly
for a MIMI SinglePart structure, but use new MultiPart and ExternalPart
objects for those corresponding MIMI structures. For a SinglePart these two fields could
be present.

- `disposition` - optional if set to the default value ("render")
- `language` - optional if absent

If there is only a single part its `part_index` is 0, and in this case it is optional.

## MultiPart

- `part_semantics` is one of "chooseOne", "singleUnit", or "processAll". It is mandatory.
- `parts` is an array of `Part`s. It is mandatory in a `MultiPart` object.

## Part

- `disposition` - optional if set to the default value ("render")
- `language` - optional if absent
- `part_index` is an unsigned integer. It is mandatory in a `Part` object.
- `cardinality` is one of "nullpart", "single", "external", or "multi". mandatory.

if cardinality is "single" or "external", then `body`, `encoding`, and `mimetype` fields are included directly in the Part object.


## ExternalPart

- `mimetype` is the value of the `contentType` in MIMI. It is mandatory if present in the MIMI message and recommended otherwise.
- `url` is the URL of the content as a text string. It is mandatory
- `expires` is a date_type (text) date. It is optional if not present.
- `size` is an integer number of octets. It is optional if not present.
- `description` is a text string. It is optional if not present.
- `filename` is a text string. It is optional if not present.
- `content_hash` is the base64url encoded string of the MIMI `contentHash` of the ExternalPart, prefixed with the name of the hash algorithm corresponding to `hashAlg` and a colon (for example "sha256:"). `content_hash` is  mandatory if it was included in the MIMI content ExternalPart, and omitted otherwise.
- `cached` is a boolean. It is mandatory if it is true, which means that a
copy of the external content is available in a vcon attachment object
(see {#attachments}). If `cache` is true and no `content_hash` is present, a new content hash is calculated for the attachment and placed the `cache_ref` field (which can only be present in this case).

ExternalPart has several fields for the decryption of the
referenced content.
If it is not necessary to reconstruct the original MIMI content (for example to allow later verification of the message ID), these fields can be omitted once the content has been downloaded, decrypted, verified, and included in the VCON attachments array. Otherwise they are mandatory if present in the MIMI content.
All of these fields are base64url encoded strings.

- `encAlg`
- `key`
- `nonce`
- `aad`

## Changes to the room {#party-history}

Changes to the room metadata or participation should be accompanied by
a new dialog type:

- room metadata changes
- participant identity change
- participants joining and leaving
- participants adding new clients
- moderation events?

**TODO** add additional fields

## party_event_type events

When there is a change to the parties represented in a room, the
`party_event_type.event` is added.

~~~ cddl
party_event_type.event /= "add" / "self_add" /
                          "leave" / "remove" / "ban"
~~~

- `add`: user added by someone else
- `self_add`: user added herself directly
- `leave`: user leaves of their own accord
- `remove`: user is removed by another user
- `ban`: user is banned from the group

# Attachments

An attachment consists of the following fields:

- `start`: is the time when the attachment was downloaded. It is mandatory.
- `party`: is the party that downloaded the attachment. It is mandatory.
- `content_hash`: is the base64url encoded hash using the hash name prefixed with a colon before the hash (ex: "sha256:"). It is mandatory.
- `dialog_object_ref` is a string consisting of: "mid:" (representing the message ID URI), the message_id of the message in the dialog object, a colon, the part_index of the Part (or "0" if the ExternalPart is at the top level), and the string "@anon.invalid"

The `mimetype`, `filename`, `encoding`, and `body` fields are as they are defined in vcon and are all mandatory.

# Message tombstones

When a message has been deleted/retracted, or it expires, it can be valuable to present a record that such a message was previously present, by generating a dialog object with the following fields:

- `type` is "tombstone"
- `start` is the time the tombstone was generated
- `message_id` is the message ID of the message.
- `status` is the status of the former message, either "retracted" or "expired".

# Examples

## MIMI examples as a VCON

The example vcon consists of the example messages from Section 5 of the MIMI content specification plus a single multipart message.

~~~
{::include examples/mimi-examples.json}
~~~

## MIMI VCON with an Attachment

This example vcon consists of a single message in a dialog which references
an attachment.
